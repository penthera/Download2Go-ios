Tutorial - HelloWorld Sample
=======================================
## Summary
A simple HelloWorld getting started example for how Penthera download and off-line playback works.
</br>
</br>

## XCode Setup
### Enable Downloads:
Dowloading Assets requires enabling App Transport Security settings in info.plist

```
> <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
> <true/>
```
</br>

### VirtuosoClientDownloadEngine.framework:
If you embed the framework directly (vs using CocoaPods) you will need to change several build settings as follows:

### Setup
To enable this demo you first need to contact Penthera Customer Support to request registration information including the following items:

* Backplane URL
* Backplane Public Key
* Backplane Private Key

Opening Info.plist search for the following:</br>

	<key>VirtuosoBackplaneUrl</key>
	<string>replace_with_your_backplane_url</string>

Replace "replace_with_your_backplane_url" with the URL Penthera Customer Support provided. 
</br>

Opening Info.plist search for the following:</br>

	<key>VirtuosoBackplaneMasterPublickey</key>
	<string>replace_with_your_public_key</string>

Replace "replace_with_your_public_key" with the Public Key Penthera Customer Support provided. 

</br>
Then scan the source code and replace "replace_with_your_public_key" with the public key provided by Penthera and replace "replace_with_your_private_key" with the private key Penthera provided. 

</br>


### Search Paths
Set Search Paths to where VirtuosoClientDownloadEngine.framework is located for the following:</br>

* Framework Search Paths
* Library Search Paths

Also make sure to include VirtuosoClientDownloadEngine.framework in both Embedded Binaries and Linked Frameworks.
</br>
</br>
### Importing Penthera SDK
You will need to create a bridging header as shown in this project to import the Penthera header.
