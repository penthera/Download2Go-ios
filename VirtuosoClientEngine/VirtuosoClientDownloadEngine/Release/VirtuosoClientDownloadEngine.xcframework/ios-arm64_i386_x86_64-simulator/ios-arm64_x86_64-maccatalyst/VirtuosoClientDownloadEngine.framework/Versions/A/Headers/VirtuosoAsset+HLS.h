/*!
 *  @abstract Creates a new in-memory HLS VirtuosoAsset.
 *
 *  @discussion This constructor uses the default expiry rules.  To customize expiry rules for this asset,
 *              use the constructors that take expiry parameters, or change the expiry values after creation.
 *
 *  @warning The SDK does not check or prevent download of Assets with codec not supported by hardware on the device.
 *
 *  @param assetID A globally unique identifier for the asset. Used in all log events.
 *                 IMPORTANT: This value must be globally unique across all assets within the Catalog.
 *                 Dupicate AssetID's are not allowed.
 *
 *  @param description A description of the asset.  Virtuoso only uses this in log output.
 *
 *  @param manifestUrl Where the manifest lives on the Internet.
 *
 *  @param protectionType You should pass the default value of kVDE_AssetProtectionTypePassthrough unless
 *                        instructed differently by Penthera support.
 *
 *  @param includeEncryption If YES, then this method will download any encryption keys in
 *                           manifest.  Normally, you would pass YES, but this allows for custom behaviors.
 *
 *  @param maximumBitrate For manifests containing multiple profiles, Virtuoso will select the highest bitrate 
 *                        profile whose bitrate doesn't exceed this value. A value of 1 means "use the lowest 
 *                        bitrate." If there's no profile of lower bitrate than maximumBitrate, Virtuoso will
 *                        select the lowest bitrate profile.  A value of INT_MAX means "use the highest bitrate."
 *
 *  @param publishDate Virtuoso will not provide API access to the asset until this date. Nil means "now."
 *
 *  @param expiryDate Virtuoso will not provide API access to the asset after this date. Nil means no expiry.
 *
 *  @param assetDownloadLimit Virtuoso applies this value instead of the backplane-defined global asset download limit
 *                            A value < 0 means to use the backplane defined value.  A value of 0 means unlimited.  A
 *                            value > 0 will be applied to download permissions checks for this asset.
 *
 *  @param enableFastPlay If enabled, Virtuoso will automatically download the initial portion of the asset as soon
 *                        as the asset is created.  Whenever an asset is streamed, the cached beginning of the asset
 *                        will be returned to the player immediatley, eliminating startup buffer time for streamed playback.
 *
 *  @param userInfo A convenience field allowing you to associate arbitrary data with an asset.
 *                  Virtuoso will serialize this data and store it, but not explicitly use this data.
 *                  The provided userInfo must be property-list compatible. May be nil.
 *
 *  @param readyBlock Called when the asset is ready to be added to the download queue
 *
 *  @param completeBlock Called when asset parsing completes. May be nil.
 *
 *  @return A new (empty) VirtuosoAsset object, or nil if there was an error.
