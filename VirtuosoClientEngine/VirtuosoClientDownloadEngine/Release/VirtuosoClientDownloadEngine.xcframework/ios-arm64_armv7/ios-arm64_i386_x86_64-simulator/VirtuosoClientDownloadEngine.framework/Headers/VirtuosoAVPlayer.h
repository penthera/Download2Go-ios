 *  @abstract A subclass of AVPlayer that is directly integrated with the Virtuoso SDK via the
 *            VirtuosoPlayer protocol.
 *
 *  @discussion The VirtuosoAVPlayer class is the lowest-level video player class available in the SDK.
 *              You can use VirtuosoAVPlayer as a drop-in replacement for AVPlayer in any custom player code
 *              you are currently using, or to build up your own player from scratch.  VirtuosoAVPlayer
 *              currently supports MP4, HLS, and MPEG-DASH assets, and is directly compatible with FairPlay
 *              and Widevine DRM platforms.  Other DRM systems, such as Adobe Primetime or Microsoft PlayReady
 *              are also supported, but require additional integration.
 *
 *  @warning You must set both the contentURL and the asset properties of this class with appropriate values
 *           before presenting the player for playback.
