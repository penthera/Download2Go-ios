 *              license fails to load, the asset continues to download, and Virtuoso will re-attempt to retrieve the

 *              at opportune times if the license request continues to fail.
 *
 *              If you would prefer that the asset not be parsed at all if the DRM request fails, you can enable this

 *              license failed.  It is expected that you will message the user appropriate and then delete the returned asset.
 *
 *  @warning    If you enable this setting, Virtuoso will take longer before reporting download start and progress, as normal
 *              parsing and download activities will be delayed until the DRM license can be confirmed.

 *              It is not usually desirable to download every available language, however, as this increases the download

 *              subtitle track.  If you set this property to an empty array, then the SDK will not download any subtitles.

 *              language.  The default value is nil.

 *  @warning If you enable this option, the download engine will not be able to differentiate between 
 *           downloaded encryption keys and other types of network content.  It is possible and, in fact, likely
 *           that your users will eventually attempt a download in these conditions and end up with unplayable

 *  @discussion By default, the SDK stops download and marks the asset with errors if it
 *              cannot download an asset segment.  If you have configured 
 *              permittedSegmentDownloadErrors with a non-zero value, then the SDK will,
 *              instead, skip over a configured number of segment errors and continue downloading.
 *              These downloads will report errors, but will be marked as completed and
 *              can be played.  By default, the SDK HTTP Proxy will return HTTP 200 status
 *              for these files with zero length.  This allows most video players to continue
 *              playing over the error.  If desired, you can use this setting to configure
 *              the proxy to return 404 NOT FOUND instead.
 *
 *              Note that this behavior only applies for segments that are missing due to 
 *              errors.  If you play an asset that has not finished downloading, the proxy
 *              will always return 404 NOT FOUND for segments that have not downloaded yet.
