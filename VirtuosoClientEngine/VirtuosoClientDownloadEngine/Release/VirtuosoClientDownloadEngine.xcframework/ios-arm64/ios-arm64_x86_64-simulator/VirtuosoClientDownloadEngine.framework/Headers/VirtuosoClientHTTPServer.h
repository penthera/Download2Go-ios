/*!
 *  @abstract A proxy layer that sits between the video player and a Virtuoso-managed (video) asset
 *
 *  @discussion A localhost HTTP proxy server that enables transparent playback of downloaded video within
 *              Apple or 3rd party video players.
 *
 *              This class abstracts the location and download state of the video from the video player.
 *              In the case of HLS video, for example, this class will generate an "on the fly"
 *              HLS manifest that lists a localhost URL for each manifest URL.  The server receives each
 *              localhost request and then returns the local or remote data, as available.
 *
 *  @warning To use this class directly, you must retain the instantiated object within your code.
 *           If you release an instantiated proxy object, the proxy will immediately shut down 
 *           and become unavailable.
